# API Example Backend with Clean Code and Node.JS - Rating Businesses

This is a sample API backend created using Clean Code and Node.js (with Express.js) which follows the TDD methodology and sticks to clean code principles. It includes two types of tests: end-to-end and performance tests, ensuring the reliability and stability of the system.

This API is designed as a real-world example of a platform that allows users to create businesses, view and do reviews of the business. Please note that the permission layer is not included in this example, so anyone can insert reviews.
